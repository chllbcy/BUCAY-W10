[Verse 1]
<br>
<i> 
It’s Saturday, I’m all alone <br>
I’m stuck inside my trailer home <br>
And all I could think of is how are you doing <br>
Going places I don’t know <br>
Interviews and TV shows <br>
But I just want to pack my things and just get going <br>
</i>
<br>
[Chorus]
<br>
<u>
'Cause all I want is you <br>
Behind the cameras I see you <br>
You know it’s always you and me <br>
And no one else will ever be <br>
The leading lady in this story <br>
That’ll always be <br>
My favorite movie <br>
</u>
<br>
[Verse 2]
<br>
<strike>
It’s 2 AM, and you’re still on my mind <br>
I’m wishing you’re here by my side tonight <br>
Missing you in every morning <br>
I can’t wait to leave this place <br>
'Cause nothing beats your sweet embrace <br>
‘Cause there’s no bеtter song than hearing your heart bеating <br>
</strike>
<br>
[Chorus]
<br>
<u>
'Cause all I want is you <br>
Behind the cameras, I see you <br>
You know it’s only you and me <br>
And no one else will ever be <br>
The leading lady in this story <br>
That will always be <br>
My favorite movie <br>
My favorite movie <br>
You know it’s only you and me <br>
And no one else will ever be <br>
The leading lady in this story <br>
That will always be <br>
My favorite movie <br>
My favorite movie <br>

<br>
[Bridge]
<br>
<em>
My favorite scene is a night full of romance <br>
As I take you to the dance <br>
With you there’ll never be a second glance <br>
To get down on my knees and take my chance <br>
</em>
<br>
[Chorus]
<br>
<strong>
You know it cause it’s you <br>
Behind the cameras, I see you <br>
You know it’s only you and me <br>
And no one else will ever be <br>
The leading lady in this story <br>
That will always be <br>
My favorite movie <br>
My favorite movie (Oh, this is a love story) <br>
You know it’s only you and me <br>
And no one else will ever be <br>
The leading lady in this story <br>
That’ll always be <br>
My favorite movie <br>
