<h1>PATIENCE</h1>
<p><b><i>According to Cambridge Dictionary, "Patience the ability to wait, or to continue doing something despite difficulties, or to suffer without complaining or becoming annoyed".
Patience is important when it comes to treatment. 
Whether you are performing a long and complicated surgery that needs focus throughout, or a treatment plan for a sick animal is taking longer than expected, having patience will make you much better at your job (VetFinders, 2022).</i></b></p>
