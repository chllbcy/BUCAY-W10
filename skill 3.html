<h1>COMPASSION</h1>
<p><b><i>According to Merriam-Webster Dictionary, the definition of the word ' Compassion ' is the "sympathetic consciousness of other's distress together with a desire to alleviate it." 
Most individuals who choose to enter the field of veterinary medicine are compassionate individuals dedicated to providing relief and healing to animals. 
This motivation provides satisfaction, reward, and fulfillment for veterinarians as they serve their clients and patients and is known as compassion satisfaction (Holden et al., 2019).</i></b></p>
