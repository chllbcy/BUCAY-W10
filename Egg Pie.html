<p>Egg Pie is a sweet Filipino dessert that resembles an egg custard. Though famous in the Philippines and can be seen even in local bakeries, this delicious dessert has not made its own identity yet and is often confused as a giant egg custard or something else. Well, now is the right time to show-off some of our countryâ€™s sweet indulgence.</p>

<p>Ingredients</p>
<ul>
<li> >>Pie Crust
<li>2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
<li>1 teaspoon salt
<li>1 cup unsalted butter chilled and cut into cubes
<li>1/4 to 1/2 cup cold water
<li>2 tablespoon granulated sugar

<li>1 3/4 cups evaporated milk
<li>3 pieces raw eggs
<li>1 piece egg white separated from the yolk
<li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract
<li>1 cup granulated sugar
</ul>

<p>Procedures</p>
<ol>
<li>Create the crust by combining the flour, sugar, and salt then mix well.

<li>Gradually pour the cold water while mixing the ingredients. Continue mixing until all the ingredients are well incorporated.
