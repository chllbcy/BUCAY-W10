<h1>OBSERVANT</h1>
<p><b><i>Observation skills refer to the ability to use all five of your senses to recognize, analyze and recall your surroundings. 
This practice is often associated with mindfulness because it encourages you to be present and aware of the details of your daily life (Indeed Editorial Team, 2022).</i></b></p>
