<h1>GENTLE HANDS</h1>
<p><b><i>The patient and the owner of the patient should feel comfortable when you are handling them. 
The way you'd want to get treated by a doctor yourself should be the way you'd treat every pet too. 
The more gently you handle an animal, the calmer they will feel with you. 
As well as helping you build a better bond with your patient, this also means youâ€™re less likely to be hurt by the animal (Skills You Need, n.d.).</i></b></p>
