<h1>ORGANISATION</h1>
<p><b><i>Many veterinary surgeries are busy places, and disorganisation can result in damage to a business, productivity, and the animals that you care for.
You may one day end up in charge of your own veterinary practice and, in this case, you will find it imperative to have a very organised place of work that allows you to achieve your goals and objectives. 
Organisation also leads to veterinary teams who work better together and are more motivated to succeed, which can only be a good thing for your business (Skills You Need, n.d.).</i></b></p>
